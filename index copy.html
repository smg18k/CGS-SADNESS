<h1>Creating Music for Spotify</h1>
<h2><em>The Basics</em></h2>
<p>
Sharing your artistic touch with the world can be a daunting task. The more you know, the easier it becomes. For starters, Spotify has a unique set up for artists.
It has a verifiable profile you can alter to fit your aesthetic outlook. The platform also has a section where you can update your fans with merch and upcoming tour dates.
A super useful feature it also offers is detailed analytics on your plays and listeners. There is the chance to submit to playlists and earn more listeners as well.
All of these things combine to make you a more knowledgable and efficient artist.
</p>

<p>
Before you get to ultilize Spotify for artists though, you need a distributor. If you are signed to a record, they most likely do the heavy lifting. If you
are an independent artist, there are several different services you can use such as CD Baby, Distrokid, etc. They are relatively inexpensive services that distribute your music
to various listening platforms. They basically function as the liason between your original content and websites like Youtube, Pandora, Apple Music, Spotify, and more.
Depending on the service's terms, you can get paid for your success and rising numbers (in terms of listeners and plays).
</p>
<p>
Once you have your music up and running on Spotify, you are going to want to reach out to people. Specifically, people who write blogs and talk about all kinds of
music. This is a hard road to navigate and requires certain tactics. It is worth it though, because the right person can boost your audience substantially. You can either
pay for an additional promotion service, or take matters into your own hands. Appealing to writers is a challenge in itself, especially with the plethora of artists already pitching
their music. So, it's important to be cautious in your approach and tacits.
</p>
<p>
There is no set formula to becoming a successful artist on Spotify. Rather, it is trial and error. It is a combination of making yourself stand out, creating quality content, and
getting it out to consumers. There is a reason they say you do not become famous overnight. Creating music for Spotify is hard work and requires more effort than
one may think at first glance. Most importantly, effort always triumphs talent. Stay persistent &amp stick to your passions.
